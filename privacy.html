                                We would like to build a strong foundation for higher education by serious and joyful learning.

                                applications provided by us (the “Apps”), and other services (collectively, together with the Website and the Apps, our
                                “Service”). We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy. Each time
                                you use our Service you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy at that time.
                                
                                The App downloaded to your device provides a learn experience and is intended for families and users of all ages.
                                Please read this policy in its entirety, including our Children’s Privacy Policy section, before using our Services. The
                                Children’s Privacy Policy will control over any conflicting provisions in our general Privacy Policy as it concerns
                                children’s data.
                                Protecting the privacy of children is especially important.
                                
                                Application: We encourage parents and teachers to supervise their child or student’s use of the App. No personal
                                information is collected or solicited from a child user of the App. We may collect analytics data (which does not
                                contain personal information) from a child’s use of the App in order to offer and develop the Service, and we may
                                collect information about a child such as age and nickname from you as part of your use of the App and in no event do we
                                collect more information than what is required to use our learning app.
                                
                                What is Personal Information and why do we collect it?
                                "Personal Information" may mean any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited
                                to, a first and last name, a home or other physical and virtual addresses like an email address or any other contact
                                information, that we may require.
                                The personal information that we collect is to identify you and to ensure that we provide you with the correct feedback
                                that you require for performance in various tests, thus, to help you get superior quality educational feedback. The
                                information collected enables us to give you convenient access to our services, offerings and products, and may help us
                                tailor your educational experience.
                                1. The Information you Share: You share your details like your name, email address, and other personal information like
                                contact details to use certain features of our Platform. We may also ask for this information at other times, such as
                                when you enter contests or other promotions sponsored by us and/or our partners. If you use a feature that requires
                                payment of a fee, we collect your credit card data or payment account information. When you use one of our paid
                                products, we track the web pages, and information that has been accessed by you, and store it on our servers. This
                                enables us to track items that you have completed, and those that you need to see.
                                2. Log information: When you access our website, the server automatically records information that your browser sends
                                us. These server logs may include information such as your web request, internet protocol address, browser type, browser
                                language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.

                                process your enquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services.
                                4. Links: We may present links in a format that enables us to keep track of whether these links have been followed or
                                not? We use this information to improve our customized content. Clicking on links may take you to Websites/Platforms
                                outside our domain. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other Websites/Platforms. We encourage our users
                                to be aware when they leave our site to read the privacy statements of each and every Website/Platform that collects
                                personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by our Platform.
                                
                                5. Public Forums: When you use certain features on our website like the discussion forums and you post or share your
                                personal information such as comments, messages, files, photos, it will be available to all users, and will be in the
                                public domain. All such sharing of information is done at your own risk. Please keep in mind that if you disclose
                                personal information in your profile or when posting on our forums this information may become publicly available.
                                6. Data Security: If you use a feature requiring payment of a fee, we transmit your credit card data to our bank for
                                processing. If we encounter a problem with payment, we may review the order information with you and our bank to resolve
                                it. We do not otherwise disclose your credit card information. We do not share your email address or your personal
                                information with third party marketers.
                                7. How do we use the data: We offer secure pages to collect sensitive information on our order form, such as credit card
                                information. We also use administrative, physical and technical precautions to help protect the confidentiality,
                                security and integrity of personal information stored on our system. We host the site at a commercial-grade data center
                                that employs extensive security practices. While no computer system is completely secure, we believe the measures
                                implemented by our Platform reduce the likelihood of security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data
                                involved.
                                We require this information to understand your needs and provide you with a better service, and in particular for the
                                following reasons:
                                1) Internal record keeping.
                                2) We may use the information to improve our products and services.
                                3) From time to time, we may also use your information to contact you for market research purposes. We may contact you
                                by email, phone, fax, Whatsapp or mail.
                                4) We may use the information to customise the Platform according to your interests.

                                How We Protect Your Information - Security and Passwords
                                Tangible Play takes what it believes to be commercially reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to
                                protect personal information. However, since no security system is impenetrable and “perfect security” does not exist on
                                the Internet, we cannot guarantee the security of personal information. We have put in place procedures to respond to
                                any suspected personal data breach and will notify you when we are legally required to do so.
                                If you create an account, you may be asked to choose a password. You should choose a password that is not easy to guess,
                                and does not use words that you would find in a dictionary. Do not disclose your password to any other person. You are
                                responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and account, and we will attribute activities that
                                occur using your account information (e.g., through the use of your password) to you. If you suspect that your password
                                has been compromised, contact us immediately at privacy.NA@byjus.com.
                                
                                Links To Third-Party Content
                                The Services may contain features or links to websites and services provided by third parties. Any information you
                                provide on third-party websites or services is provided directly to the operators of such services and is subject to
                                those operators’ policies, if any, governing privacy and security, even if accessed through the Website. We are not
                                responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of third-party websites or services to which
                                links or access are provided through the Services. We encourage you to learn about third parties’ privacy and security
                                policies before providing them with information.
                                Changes to this Policy
                                Any changes in this Policy will be updated & posted on this Platform. Please check back periodically, and especially
                                before you provide any personally identifiable information.
